## Pantry Pal <hr>

Pantry Pal is an applicaton that will allow you to keep track of all your foods before they expire!  With a simple and intuitive UI, you can always keep track of the current status of your foods!.

## Motivation <hr>

Do you find that you often forget about the food in the back of your fridge or hidden away in your pantry?  I know that this happens to me a lot.  I wanted to make an application that would be simple enough to use and informative enough so that I can always keep track of the foods that I have.

## Tech/Framework Used <hr>

2. Run `npm i` to install all node packages
3. Create database by going into db folder and with mysql shell, run: `SOURCE schema.sql;`<br>
